# PS2Floppy
Floppy adapter for IBM PS/2 Models 77(i and s included), 85 and 95A.

Lets you use a regular PC drive on the above models. Media sense hardwired for 1.44MB/720kB depending on drive's density switch (i.e. normal PC operation).

Male header that connects to floppy cable should be placed and soldered straddling the PCB (note that usually PCBs are made 1.6mm thick, distance between rows on header is 2.54mm -  be prepared to make goopy joints on one side). Female header that attaches to planar should be placed on top of silkscreen saying so, and soldered from opposite side.

Power cable optional, but a tap for 5V is provided.
